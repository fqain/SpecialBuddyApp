# SpecialBuddyApp
Final Year Project - Android Mobile Application to help people with disabilities to overcome social isolation

# My Final Year Project

# About
The reason for this Project’s development was to assist people with various disabilities (physical
and mental) and help them socially interact with people without any disabilities using a real time
buddy mobile application. The aim is to create an android mobile based application that would
help people with disabilities to overcome their solitude and to interact with peers or buddies
without much difficulty using a social online platform. This project will consist of an Android
Application, a Firebase Database, a Chat Service, and a Geo-Location Service, while including
accessibility features to cater for various (visual, hearing, etc.) impairments. As a huge issue among
people with disabilities is social loneliness and solitude. The app will be able to buddy a person(s)
with disabilities and a person(s) without disability together which will allow them to communicate
via the mobile application.
